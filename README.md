# ChatGPT API Project with ReactJS and JavaScript

This project demonstrates the integration of OpenAI's ChatGPT API with a ReactJS frontend and a JavaScript backend. The application allows users to interact with the ChatGPT model to generate responses in real-time. The backend handles API requests to OpenAI, while the frontend provides a sleek, user-friendly interface for user interactions.

## Features

- **Real-Time Interaction**: Users can send queries and receive responses in real-time from ChatGPT.
- **Responsive Design**: The UI is fully responsive and works across different devices and screen sizes.
- **Secure API Usage**: Implements best practices for securing API keys and managing sensitive data.
